## Clusters Info

可以发现**cluster2，12，14，15，16**是patient-enrich的，需要重点研究，特别是**cluster2**，ERM和PDR PBMC占了大部分，仅有少量的Health PBMC，可能是有Biomarker的存在

按照样本名来分类也可以看到Cluster2中以ERM和PDR PBMC为主

非经典monocyte/neutrophils?

{% hint style="info" %}
**FCGR3A/FCGR3B**: Receptor for the Fc region of IgG, FcγRIIIA is expressed on** **NK cells, monocytes, and macrophages; _FCGR3B_ is expressed on polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN)

**CXCR2**: a prominent** **chemokine receptor expressed on the cell surface of both neutrophils and monocyte_s; CXCR2_ is an essential regulator of neutrophil recruitment to inflamed and damaged sites and plays prominent roles in inflammatory pathologies and cancer.

**VNN2**: _** **_play a role in oxidative-stress response and transendothelial migration of neutrophils, _VNN2 _has also been shown to be expressed on a subset of CD14 + monocytes

**NCF2**: neutrophil cytosolic factor 2, a component of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase complex that produces superoxide

## Some Findings

* Relation between polymorphonuclear neutrophils(FCGR3B marker) and diabetes & diabetic retinopathy

\[2015-Diabetes-Neutrophils Are Associated With Capillary Closure in Spontaneously Diabetic Monkey Retinas]\([https://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/54/5/1534](https://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/54/5/1534)) -- 恒河猴模型中，糖尿病的严重程度和视网膜病变的发展与糖尿病视网膜中neutrophils的增加有关。且neutrophils数量与总胆固醇水平 (R = 0.907)、低密度脂蛋白胆固醇 (R = 0.875)、总胆固醇与高密度脂蛋白胆固醇比率 (R = 0.86) 、总甘油三酯 (R = 0.888)呈正相关。

* CXCR2 and PDR

> CXCR2 participates in the activation of neutrophils by interacting with IL-8 as an effective chemokine receptor \[38,39]. For the potential pathogenic role of CXCR2 during the initiation and progression of PDR, CXCR2 participates first in immune regulation and angiogenesis \[40], which would be both potential pathogenesis for PDR in multiple pathogenic conditions. Second, a recent publication has also confirmed the regional expression pattern and immune regulatory role of such gene in retina tissues \[41], thereby validating the tissue-specific expression pattern and pathogenic regulatory contribution of CXCR2. CXCR2 can be regarded as a specific PDR-associated gene due to its immune regulatory biological functions and angiogenesis regulation potentials.
